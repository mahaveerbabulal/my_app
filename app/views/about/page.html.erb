<p>This project deals with Inventory of windshield Glass. Here we would manage the Input and Output of the Inventory.

Once the good is consumed by shopfloor, the same needs to be updated and the quantity would be reduced by the number of quantity consumed. We would maintain a list of all the different product received, existing stock, consumed, report.</p>
